# Coursera Server

A NestJS backend application for managing courses.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Bun package manager
- MongoDB running locally or accessible remotely

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install
```

## Configuration

The application is configured to connect to MongoDB at `mongodb://localhost:27017/coursera`. If you need to change this connection string, edit the `src/database/database.module.ts` file.

## Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
bun run start:dev

# Run in debug mode
bun run start:debug

# Standard development mode
bun run start

# Production mode
bun run start:prod
```

The application will run on port 3000 by default. You can change this by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

Once running, you can access:
- API at: http://localhost:3000
- API Documentation (Swagger): http://localhost:3000/api-docs

## Running with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system

### Development Setup
```bash
# Build and start the application with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f api
```

### Environment Variables
The application requires the following environment variables:
- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation
- `PORT`: (Optional) Port to run the application on (default: 3000)

For local development, create a `.env` file in the project root with these variables. For production deployment, set these variables in your deployment environment.

### Production Deployment
When deploying to production:
1. Ensure environment variables are set in your hosting environment
2. Do not include the `.env` file in your deployment
3. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t coursera-server .`
4. Run the container with proper environment variables:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
     -e MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri \
     -e JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret \
     coursera-server
   ```

## Deployment with Docker Compose

For development or staging environments, you can use Docker Compose which includes a MongoDB instance:

```bash
# Start the services
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the services
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Troubleshooting Docker Deployment

If you encounter issues with MongoDB connection:

1. Verify your MongoDB URI is correctly formatted (should start with `mongodb://` or `mongodb+srv://`)
2. If using a local MongoDB with Docker, use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` to access the host machine
3. Ensure your MongoDB instance is accessible from the container network
4. Check logs for connection errors using: `docker logs <container_id>`

## API Endpoints

- `GET /courses` - Get all courses
- `GET /courses/:id` - Get a specific course by ID
- `POST /courses` - Create a new course

## Example Course Payload

```json
{
  "title": "Introduction to NestJS",
  "description": "Learn the basics of NestJS framework",
  "instructor": "John Doe",
  "duration": 120
}
```

## Project Structure

- `src/courses` - Course module with controller, service, and schema
- `src/database` - Database module for MongoDB connection
- `src/logger` - Winston logger configuration
- `src/users` - User management module
- `src/auth` - Authentication and authorization module

## Error Handling

The application uses Winston for error logging. Logs are stored in:
- `logs/combined.log` - All logs
- `logs/error.log` - Error logs only
